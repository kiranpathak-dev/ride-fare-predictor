Conclusion\n","\n","1. This is not a great model, but depending on how it's used it could still be useful. If the objective is only to help give taxi drivers a better idea of whether someone will leave a good tip, then it could be useful. It may be worthwhile to test it with a select group of taxi drivers to get feedback.\n","\n","2. Unfortunately, XGBoost is not the most transparent machine learning algorithm. We know that `predicted_fare`, `mean_duration`, and `mean_distance` are the most important features, but we don't know how they influence tipping. This would require further exploration.\n","\n","3.  There are almost always additional features that can be engineered, but hopefully the most obvious ones were generated during the first round of modeling. In our case, we could try creating three new columns that indicate if the trip distance is short, medium, or far. We could also engineer a column that gives a ratio that represents (the amount of money from the fare amount to the nearest higher multiple of $5) / fare amount. \n","\n","For example, if the fare were \\\\$12, the value in this column would be 0.25, because \\\\$12 to the nearest higher multiple of \\\\$5 (\\\\$15) is \\\\$3, and \\\\$3 divided by \\\\$12 is 0.25. The intuition for this feature is that people might be likely to simply round up their tip, so journeys with fares with values just under a multiple of \\\\$5 may have lower tip percentages than those with fare values just over a multiple of \\\\$5. We could also do the same thing for fares to the nearest \\\\$10.\n","\n","\n","$$round5\\_ratio = \\frac{amount\\ of\\ money\\ from\\ the\\ fare\\ amount\\ to\\ the\\ nearest\\ higher\\ multiple\\ of\\ $5}{fare\\ amount}$$   \n","\n"," \n","  $$ = \\frac{5 - (fare\\ mod\\ 5)}{fare\\ amount}$$  \n"," \n","\n","\n","4. It would probably be very helpful to have past tipping behavior for each customer. It would also be valuable to have accurate tip values for customers who pay with cash.\n","It would be helpful to have a lot more data. With enough data, we could create a unique feature for each pickup/dropoff combination."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8c8bb3bb","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.041057,"end_time":"2023-09-07T13:04:26.061645","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-09-07T13:04:26.020588","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Results Summary\n","The resulting algorithm is usable to predict riders who might be generous tippers, but has serious limitations to its usability in informing business decisions."]}],"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.4"},"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.12"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":571.679822,"end_time":"2023-09-07T13:04:26.826799","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2023-09-07T12:54:55.146977","version":"2.4.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
